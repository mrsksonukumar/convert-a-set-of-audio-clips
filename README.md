# convert-a-set-of-audio-clips
 convert a set of audio clips in MP3 format to WAV format and save it in the output folder
Install the required libraries by running pip install pydub.
Create a new Python file in your preferred text editor and copy the above script into it.
Save the file with a .py extension (e.g. mp3_to_wav_converter.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script with the command python mp3_to_wav_converter.py path/to/mp3/folder path/to/output/folder.
For example, if your MP3 files are in a folder called mp3_files and you want to save the converted WAV files in a folder called wav_files, you would run the command python mp3_to_wav_converter.py mp3_files wav_files. The converted WAV files will be saved in the wav_files folder.
